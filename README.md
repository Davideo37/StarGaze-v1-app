# CPS 350 & COM 371 Joint Mobile App Project

* Author: David Gurge & John Chan

* Class: CPS 350 Mobile Computing

* Professor: Dr. Russ Tuck

* # Project Goal:
* Create a simple mobile app to solve a specific problem for a set of users, using one of the data sources provided (or an alternative approved by the instructors).  Work in cross-functional teams with at least one member from each class. The team will work collaboratively to develop a prototype app, test it with users, and refine it as much as possible into an easy-to-use app that solves its usersâ€™ problem well, and is delightful to them in both form and function.
* Additional Requirements:
 * You must use external data via a RESTful web API.

# Stargaze App
* The app we designed is meant to solve the problem many asipiring stargazers face, when they seek to find a good night to stargaze. Our app uses a RESTful weather API to fetch forecasted weather data for the upcoming nights, and reports to the user whether a future night would be ideal for stargazing or not. Ideal stargazing conditions are calculated via a combination of weather, temperature and cloud coverage on the night in question.
